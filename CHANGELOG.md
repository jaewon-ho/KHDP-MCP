# Changelog

All notable changes to `khdp-connector`.

The format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Login is now OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE** (RFC 7636)
  using a loopback redirect (RFC 8252 §7.3). The previous
  `mail + password` flow is preserved as commented-out reference but
  is no longer exposed in the CLI (`khdp login` opens a browser).
- `khdp login` accepts only `--no-browser` (prints the URL instead of
  launching one). `--email` / `--password-stdin` are removed.
- Token refresh now uses `POST /_api/oauth/refresh-token`
  (was `/member/refresh-token`).
- Token responses normalise `expires_in` (OAuth-standard) in addition
  to legacy `expireTime`.
- CLI dispatch switched to `args.func` so subparser groups can attach
  their own handlers; the previous `_DISPATCH` dict is gone.

### Added
- `khdp datasets` subcommand group:
  - `list`, `show`, `files`, `download-link`, `download`.
  - Ref form `<code>[@<version>]`; `<code>` alone defaults to `@latest`.
  - `download` paginates `files-download-link-all` (1000 keys/page),
    streams every file to `--out`, prints per-page + per-file progress
    (file count, byte totals formatted as KB/MB/GB).
  - `download --max-pages N` stops after N pages; `download --dry-run`
    lists keys/sizes without fetching.
- `khdp submissions` subcommand group:
  - `list`, `licenses`, `show`, `create`, `mkdir`, `upload`,
    `list-files`, `delete`, `submit`.
  - `licenses` lists the available licenses (id / code / name)
    that `create --license-id` requires.
  - Ref form `<code>[@<version>]`; `<code>` alone defaults to `@1.0.0`
    (the canonical first version of a freshly created submission).
  - `create` POSTs the new submission (`title` / `code` / `version` /
    `lId` / `summary` / `accessPolicy`).
  - `mkdir --path /a/b/c` splits parent + leaf and POSTs to
    `files/directory`.
  - `upload <ref> <local-file> [--to /dir] [--name new.dcm]` issues a
    presigned URL via `POST files/presigned-url` and streams the
    payload with `PUT`.
  - `submit` triggers the `Writing → AuthorReview / AdminReview`
    transition on the backend.
- `config.authorize_url` (`KHDP_AUTHORIZE_URL`) overrides the KHDP web
  URL the browser is sent to during login. Default is derived from
  `api_base` host with `/external/oauth-login`.
- `Session.request()` for anonymous-allowed endpoints — uses the
  cached bearer if present, falls back to an anonymous call otherwise.

### Removed
- Stale `khdp_auth_login` MCP tool from the PLAN.md roadmap.
  Login is intentionally CLI-only (browser interaction required).

### Internal
- `_LoopbackCallbackHandler` HTTP server is now bound + listening
  *before* the browser is opened, removing a race where a fast
  redirect could arrive before the listener was up.
